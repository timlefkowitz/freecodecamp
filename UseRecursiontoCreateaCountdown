//Use Multiple Conditional (Ternary) Operators
//In the previous challenge, you used a single conditional operator. You can also chain them together to check for multiple conditions.
//
//The following function uses if, else if, and else statements to check multiple conditions:



function checkSign(num) {

}

checkSign(10);







return num > 0 ? "positive" : num < 0 ? "negative" : "zero"



}
