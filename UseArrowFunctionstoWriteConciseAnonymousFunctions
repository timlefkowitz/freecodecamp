/*
Use Arrow Functions to Write Concise Anonymous Functions
In JavaScript, we often don't need to name our functions, especially when passing a function 
as an argument to another function. Instead, we create inline functions. We don't need to 
name these functions because we do not reuse them anywhere else.


Rewrite the function assigned to the variable magic which returns a new Date() 
to use arrow function syntax. Also, make sure nothing is defined using the keyword var.
*/


var magic = function() {
  return new Date();
};
